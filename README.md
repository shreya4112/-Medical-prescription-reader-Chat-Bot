# -Medical-prescription-reader-Chat-Bot
A medical prescription reader chatbot that extracts and translates prescription details into the userâ€™s selected language.
The Medical Prescription Reader Chatbot is an intelligent system designed to interpret handwritten or printed medical prescriptions and translate the extracted information into a user-selected regional language. Leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and natural language processing techniques, the chatbot accurately identifies key details such as medication names, dosages, and instructions. It then uses a language model to translate and present this information in a clear, understandable format tailored to the user's linguistic preference. This enhances accessibility and ensures that patients can comprehend their prescriptions, promoting better adherence to treatment and reducing the risk of medication errors.
